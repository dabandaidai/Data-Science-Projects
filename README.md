# Data Science Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of my data science and machine learning projects.  
These projects showcase my work in data processing, analytics, machine learning, workflow automation, and model development.

Due to confidentiality, some of my most impactful industry and research projects cannot be shared here.  
However, reference materials are provided where possible.

## GM Financial (Industry Experience)

Projects completed during my internship at **GM Financial** involve proprietary internal datasets and therefore cannot be uploaded.

However, you may view my presentation slides here(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zonzIE1YnjyrEMwcWaSanGNLhvXi-xYb/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115060514280615812421&rtpof=true&sd=true) summarizing the work (shared only when permitted). These projects focused on:

- Large-scale data engineering on Azure Databricks  
- Automated data validation and anomaly detection pipelines  
- Real-time speech/text processing for customer interaction analytics  
- Distributed data warehousing and KPI reporting  
- Improving data quality and workflow efficiency across business units

## Public Projects (In This Repository)

This repository contains several **fully reproducible public data science projects**, including:

- End-to-end machine learning pipelines  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing  
- ETL / data cleaning workflows  
- Deep learning prototypes  
- Data validation utilities and automation scripts  

Each project folder includes documentation explaining the problem, methodology, and results.
