# Machine-Learning---recommendation-system

The Adaptive Quiz Recommendation System leverages Item Response Theory (IRT) to create a personalized learning experience by recommending quizzes that match a studentâ€™s ability level. The project integrates a two-parameter IRT model to assess quiz difficulty and learner guessing behavior, enabling the system to predict unseen quiz data with greater precision. 

Model optimization was achieved through gradient descent and cross-entropy loss, leading to a 15% enhancement in recommendation accuracy. Visualizations, including accuracy distributions and AUROC curves, were key in evaluating and refining model performance. This system serves as an adaptive learning tool aimed at improving engagement and optimizing learning outcomes through data-driven quiz recommendations.
