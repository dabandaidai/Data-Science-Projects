\section{Training Results}

\subsection{Training Loop Printout}
Place your training loop printout in this section.

\paragraph{Model without Attention}
\begin{verbatim}
This is an example of a printout.
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively, you can depict the WandB graphs as shown in figure \ref{fig:train_bleu_wo_attention} \& \ref{fig:train_loss_wo_attention}. The numbers shown are for illustration purposes only and the loss and BLEU values presented are fabricated. You should expect very different outcomes.  We recommend exporting your charts as {\tt .png} files following this tutorial: \url{https://wandb.ai/site/articles/export-data-from-wb}.

\paragraph{Model with Single-headed Attention}


\paragraph{Model with Multi-headed Attention}


\subsection{Test Set BLEU Score}
This section lists the test set BLEU score reported on the test set for each model in table \ref{tab:bleu}.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
Model                              & Test BLEU \\ \hline
Model without Attention            & 0.0       \\ \hline
Model with Single-headed Attention & 0.0       \\ \hline
Model with Multi-headed Attention  & 0.0       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The BLEU score reported on the test set for each model.}
\label{tab:bleu}
\end{table}

\subsection{Discussion}

{\it In this section, write a brief discussion on your findings. Was there a discrepancy in between training and testing results? Why do you think that is? If one model did better than the others, why do you think that is?}

\section{Translation Analysis}

\subsection{Translations}

List all of your translations in this section.

\subsection{Discussion}
{\it In this section, write a brief discussion on your findings. Describe the quality of
those sentences. Can you observe any correlation with the modelâ€™s BLEU score?}
